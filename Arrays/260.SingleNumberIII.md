## Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.
You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0]
Output: [-1,0]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]

**approach:** 
1.  i would be using pointers method. 
2. first i would sort the array and traverse the array based on the condition and check the condition. 

```cpp 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans;
        int i = 0;
        while(i < n){
            if(i+1 < n && nums[i] == nums[i+1]){
                i+=2
            }else{
                ans.push_back(nums[i]);
                i++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
tc : O(nlogn + n)
sc : O(1) and O(k) --- k is for return the ans vector
