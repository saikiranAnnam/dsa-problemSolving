## Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

**brute force apporach :**
1. so we have an array nums[] with len 'n' so i would be taking an extra temp arr or list, to store the 
non-zero elements in the temp array. 
2. once storing the temp arr, lets push all the non-zero elements to the nums array. 
3. we already knew the size of temp arr, now we would pushing zeros's to end of the nums with index [temp.size].

**code**
```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        # here storing all the non-zero elements in the temp array
        temp = []
        for i in range(nums):
            if arr[i] != 0:
                temp.push(arr[i])


        for i in range(len(temp)):
            arr[i] = temp[i]

        non-zero = temp.size

        for i in range(non-zero, n):
            arr[i] = 0

```

**follow up question : can you slove this code more effiecently, like space complexity to be constant and Could you minimize the total number of operations done?**

**optimal apporach:**
Certainly! Below is the LeetCode approach type for your solution:

**Approach: Two-Pointer (Optimized)**
1. Set `j` to 0 to keep track of the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
2.  Use a single loop to iterate through the array.
3.  If the current element is non-zero, swap it with the element at position `j` and increment `j`.
4. After the traversal, all non-zero elements have been moved to the front, and zeros are at the end of the array.


```python 
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        #find first zero element
        j = -1 
        n = len(nums)
        for i in  range(n):
            if(nums[i] == 0):
                j = i
                break
        #if no zero elements 
        if(j == -1 ) : return 
        # swap non-zero with zero element 
        for i in range(j+1, n):
            if(nums[i] != 0):
                nums[j] , nums[i] = nums[i], nums[j]
                j+=1
        
```
