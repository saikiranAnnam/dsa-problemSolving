## Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

**better apporach:**
1. i will create hash arr, and store the frequency of the array. 
2. if the frequency of the array in the element is 1 and that is answer. 

**code**
```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
   maxi = nums[0]
   hashArr = {}
   for i in range(len(nums)):
    maxi = max(maxi, nums[i])

   hashArr[maxi] = {0}

   for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] not in hashArr:
        hashArr[nums[i]] = 1
    else:
        hashArr[nums[i]] +=1 
   
   for i in range(len(nums)):
    if (hashArr[nums[i]] == 1):
                return nums[i]

   return -1

```
