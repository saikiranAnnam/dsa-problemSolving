## Problem Statment
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

1.  The task is to find the max consecutive 1's in an array, so i will just traverse
through the array and taking a variable(count = 0) running through and increment it until we find 0. 
2. once if we find 0, then i will have[max = 1] max = max(count, max). 
3. i will return to loop and check the count element again. 


**code** 

```python 
def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    max_count = 0
    for i in range(nums):
        if(nums[i] == 1):
            count +=1 
            max_count = max(max_count, count)
        else:
            count = 0
    return max_count
```
