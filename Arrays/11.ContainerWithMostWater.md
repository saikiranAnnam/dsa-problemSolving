## Problem Statment

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

**brute force apporach:** 
lets take one height, and run the inner loop so that we can check all the combination to get the maximum area. 

here to note that the water is splitted if the height is greater than the mini height. 

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0 
        n = len(height)
        for l in range(n):
            for r in range(l, n):
                ar = (r-l) * min(height[l], height[r])
                res = max(res, ar)
        return res
```

tc : O(n^2)
sc : constant

**optimal apporach:**

now we take, two pointer apporach where we take the left and right pointer. 

here the left pointer moves if it is less than right side height. 
and for the right pointer moves if it is less than the left pointer height. 


```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        l,r = 0,n-1
        res = 0
        while(l < r):
            area = (r-l) * min(height[l], height[r])
            res = max(area, res)

            if(height[l] > height[r]):
                r -=1
            else:
                l +=1

        return res 
```

tc : O(n)
sc : constant
