## problem statement 
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

**brute force apporach :**
1. as we saw in the previous problem - rotate array left by one. here also i want to follow same approach by 
taking an temp arr of size k and store the first k elements in the temp arr. 
2. i will run a pointer j from k element in the main arr to the end and shift them to starting index. 
3. Once the shifting is complete i will push the elements in the temporary elements into the main arr. 

```cpp

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 

1 2 3 
0 1 2

4,5,6,7,0,0,0
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 

void rotate(vector<int> &nums, int k){
    
    //storing k elements in the temp arr
    //O(k)
    vector<int> temp;
    for(int i = 0; i<k;i++){
        temp.emplace_back(arr[i])
    }

    //O(n-k)
    // shifting the elements in the main arr
    for(int j=k; j<n;j++){
        arr[j-k] = arr[j];
    }

    O(k)
    //pushing temp elements to main arr 
    for(int i = n-d;k<temp.size();i++){
        arr[i] = temp[i-(n-d)];
    }
    return;
} 
```
NOTE : here the tc = O(n) and sc = O(k)

**follow up question : can you slove this code more effiecently, like space complexity to be constant**

**optimal apporach:**

In this apporach, i would be using reversal algorithm. 
1. lets say the we break the arr until k elements like size arr(0,k) and reverse it.
2. then another half arr(k+1, n) and reverse it. 
3. then reverse the total arr(0, n).

**NOTE:** here if the k is more then the size of the array. 
here's how  you think. 

lets k = 11 // it means u need to 11 rotations
here the size of the array is 7. 
means if k = 7 it means the array remain constant. 

we can re-write the 11 as = 7 + 4 // means the array will be shifiting only 4 rotations. 

another example : lets say k = 15 => 7 + 7 + 1 // means the array will be shifting only 1 rotation. 

**code**
```cpp
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 

first k elements reverse arr(0, k)
[3,2,1,4,5,6,7] 

next half reverse arr(k+1,n)
[3,2,1,7,6,5,4]

then reverse whole arr(0, n)
[4,5,6,7,1,2,3]

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        k = k % n;
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin()+n-k);
        reverse(nums.begin() + n - k, nums.end());
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    }
};

```
TC : O(n) 
sc : O(1) --> no extra space is required

lets say that programming language doesnt have reverse fucntion. 

for python the solution would be like this 

```python

def Solution : 
    def reverse(arr, start, end): 
        while start <= end:
            arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
            start += 1
            end -= 1

    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        n = len(nums)
        k = k % n
        reverse(nums, 0, n - k - 1)
        reverse(nums, n - k, n - 1)
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1)



```
